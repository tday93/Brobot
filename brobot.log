    SCH's new skill. With this freshly torn-off page...

And now, this isn't related to healers in any way, but since I caught wind of some grief about how only DRG's screenshot didn't include a new skill (this was originally only going to be screenshots of scenery...), here's a present for our DRGs, so big it bleeds!

any attachment that came at them through e-mail and encrypting all the
files on their systems and other network systems....so...I installed a
Linux box running Samba backed by a ZFS file store.

Samba spits out syslog records on file writes.

Combine that with fail2ban.  When one user has more than 60 writes in
60 seconds *or* a write contains a well-known cryptolocker name (i.e.
*DECRYPT_INSTRUCT*) it immediately blocks their IP on the server,
looks up their MAC address, scans the switch for their MAC, and
disables the switch port.

Then I have a list of files in syslog that were encrypted and ZFS
snapshots I can restore from.

Additionally, some of the workstations were PXE or iSCSI booted from
the NAS so it was as simple as "Hold down the power button to turn off
your computer.  Ok, let me 'zfs rollback' your machine image...ok, now
turn your computer back on.  All set."

Plus adding new workstations was as easy as getting the MAC address
and doing a 'zfs clone' of a clean machine image.

Upgrades are easy too--boot a VM, install the latest version of
WIndows, update drivers, install software packages, then shutdown,
snapshot and clone.  Tell the user to reboot their PC and they are now
running the newer OS.

Windows isn't hard if you have Linux and Unix running underneath,
behind, and between everything. ;)

I should know what I'm talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine katana in Japan for 2,400,000 Yen (that's about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my katana.

Japanese smiths spend years working on a single katana and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest blades known to mankind.

Katanas are thrice as sharp as European swords and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a longsword can cut through, a katana can cut through better. I'm pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.

Ever wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan? That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction. Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected.'

A) I'm not familiar with the exact language they develop in (Elixir), but it doesn't seem to be especially relevant because Elixir fundamentally is just Erlang, about which I know enough to get me in trouble but probably not out of trouble. So basically the problems that they were running into is that details matter and limitations add up. For the uninitiated, Erlang is a language that was basically purpose-built for distributed computing (originally telephone switches). It sweeps a lot of details under the rug because it treats those parts of the problem (specifically, how do I do work with multiple workers and allow them to have access to the information they need to get their jobs done) as a fundamental mechanism of how any bit of code executes in Erlang, period. What they were discovering is that as they needed to deliver more and more messages in parallel, things that were under the hood started becoming a significant roadblock. The blog post they reference talks about how its basically a 7-fold decrease in performance doing the same thing in the language depending on whether the worker doing the work is on your node or on another node in the group, literally just because of the extra overhead and complexity of touching the network.'

They say they considered this treatment at the end of last year, when Connie Yates found out about it online and raised it with them. In a statement last month, the hospital said it had actually applied for ethical permission to try the experimental drug on Charlie, even though it had never been used before on a patient with his condition.

“By the time that decision was made, Charlie’s condition had greatly worsened and the view was that his epileptic encephalopathy was such that his brain damage was severe and irreversible that treatment was potentially painful but incapable of achieving anything positive for him,” said the hospital.```'

The filing is classically Amazon in its competitive boldness: it is dated July 6 — coming just days after Blue Apron’s rocky IPO. Blue Apron is down by 10.4 percent in trading this morning, very close to its lowest point.

Amazon describes the service simply: “Prepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or and vegetables and also including sauces or seasonings, ready for cooking and assembly as a meal; Frozen, prepared, and packaged meals consisting of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or vegetables; fruit salads and vegetable salads; soups and preparations for making soups.”'

09/05/2017 12:28:39 PM Received message: 'From the CCP's point of view, the latest nuclear test is a clear taunt aimed directly at Beijing. The timing of the test is crucial, Kim tested the bomb just before the 9th BRICS summit in which Xi hosted the leaders from all five states to show offchinese development and prestiage to the international community and the test was a massive embrassment and a slap to the face to Xi and the ccp. From this point forward Xi has two option to respond, one is for Xi to competely revamp Chinese policy towards NK taking a more hardline stance and prehaps even goes as far to cooperate with US to sees its downfall. Second is the appeasement policy as China has done so far, prehaps cutting fuel shipment for a week or two but Chinese wouldn't seriously implemented the sanction over the long term. Before i answer what choice likely Xi would made, we have to understand that CCP's number one priority in the short term is the 19 th national congress of this october. The congress will the marked the end of Xi's first term has leader and it is expected Xi to consolidate more power to him and his faction. It is also in CCP's interest to make sure nothing internally or externally to distrupt or distube the event. Chinese has a term for this, it is called Stability Maintenance. It is a catchall term in which the ccp has grown accustomed to in response to riots and protest that arupted throughout the years. The CCP is also expected to maintain stability with Kim by appeasing him because for the ccp the 19th national congress is all that mattered.
However, the problem with all these maintence tactics the ccp used over the years is that they are short-termed tactics that delays the crisis/problems to the future. So it runs the risk of being seen as both as a betrayal and Deceitful by Trump and Kim. So i expect the Kim to do another massive test just before the october congress to further flip off to Xi'

Stop signs are, however, "official traffic control devices" [See Vehicle Code §440 and §21400], but probably not a traffic control "signal" device.   Thus, in such case, you can, arguably, in most cases, cross anywhere on the road.  However, be warned that it is reported that many police officers consider stop signs to be a "traffic control signal devices"; therefore, you may receive a ticket for jaywalking.  If so, you will have to make legal argument (or hire an attorney to do so) and seek to convince a judge that a stop sign is not a "traffic control signal device".```'

Sure judge this guy for liking a character from an anime. But then go out watch the Avengers, or Game of Thrones, or whatever previously nerdy show or movie made popular by the media.
And no a figurine or a signed guitar or a poster are all equivalents. It's all the same, it's all memorabilia."'

It has a convenient sliding door can go smoothly along the rails. This can be used to carry small Lego cargo and many other things that can can fit in it. I think this would be a good Lego product because I have done some research and there isn’t any think like this on the Lego market. This creation would be good for people who are in  possession of a Lego train. I think that it would do good in a poly bag for buyers who want something cheap.”```'

The coordination required is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical mathematics most of the mechanics will go over a typical player’s head. There’s also the high amount of skills needed, which is deftly woven into the encounter design - the design heavily utilize Fourier series, for instance. The savage raiders understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these mechanics, to realise that they’re not just challenging - they say something deep about THE UNIVERSE. As a consequence people who can't clear O4S truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the Almagest mechanic, which itself is a Lebesgue measure. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Yoshi P’s genius wit unfolds itself on their PC screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Deltascape tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎'

Who sends warmest anything to the families of murder victims? Vice-President Mike Pence, who is not a sociopath, merely a Republican, knew that the right language is the language of bafflement, talking about “senseless violence” and the rest."'
