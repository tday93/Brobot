The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎'

03/27/2018 11:25:37 AM Received message: 'Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.'

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.'

When asked how he originally prepared for this season, James spoke honestly about his regiment. "The same thing I always do. Head down to my friend Dion's [Waiters] place on his island. It's one of the most relaxing places in the world. The ocean breeze lulls you to sleep in the late hours. And the sun's warmth wakes you in the morning."

"On Sunday's we'd pick apples in the orchard. And in the afternoons, play one-on-one in the court behind the house, secluded behind the Sycamore trees. My Dion checking the ball to me, staring deeply into my eyes. Piercing into my soul."

"Soon our shirts were off. His body against mine as he drove to the rim. When the game ended, he laid me down at center court. The warmth of the pavement against my back, his strong arms engulfed me. There, he entered me. First softly, then deeper and faster. Then I felt his body tense as he let out a loud 'and one.' And in that moment, I was forever his LeBron."'

Why are there fart noises coming out of your bathroom, Foxxie?

Uh- Oh. Those arent farts, its steam from the steamy sex we'll be having. Mmmm steamy sex... Whew Superlewdtendent i hope youre ready for some mouthwatering fellatio
I thought you said we were having steamy anal?

D'oh, no. I said creamy suckles. Thats what i call blowjobs.
You call blowjobs creamy suckles?

Yes. It's a erp dialect.
Uh-huh, from what discord server?

Uh, e621's.
Really. Well, I yiff there daily and ive never heard anyone use the phrase "creamy suckles."

Oh, not e621 official. It's a fan server.
I see, you know. your butt smells alot like the ones i did in the mcdonalds bathroom stalls.

Oh, no. Non-slutty MCfoxbutt here. I dont yiff with randoms.
yiff with randoms? and you say that despite we only just met 5 minutes ago?

Ye- you know, the- One thing I should - Excuse me for one second.
Of course.

Well, that was wondeful. A hot time we had. Im pooped.
Yes. I should be- Good Lewd! What is happening in there?

I think that he provides an answer himself that sidesteps the dichotomy entirely. To Mario, his incarnations are all beings that exist separately, and yet they're all part of one unifying Mario identity- they're still genuinely him, even though they could all exist independently.
