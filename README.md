brobot-3000, a weird little discord bot


There are a number of files that are referenced but aren't shown here because they may contain personal or identifying information. 



factoids.json stores brobot's triggers and responses

reactions.json stores brobot's reactions to various things

quotes.json stores user quotes

SECRETS.yaml is used to store various API keys

There are also several pictures referenced that aren't stored here because I don't want to track down licenses for them. Find your own pictures of butter.
